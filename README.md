### Hi there, Iâ€™m [Mahmud Ahsan](https://mahmudahsan.com) ðŸ‘‹

Serial entrepreneur and Full-Stack Developer passionate about crafting exceptional web and mobile experiences. With a strong foundation in Next.js, React, and TypeScript, I have co-founded three companies, leveraging my expertise to drive innovation and business growth. My professional journey includes full-time roles and extensive freelancing experience, allowing me to adapt quickly and deliver results in diverse environments.

In my current role, I architected and developed the CheckWhatsGood web application from scratch. Utilizing Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and other cutting-edge technologies, I handled end-to-end developmentâ€”encompassing both frontend and backendâ€”resulting in a robust application now used by thousands of users.

My focus is on building scalable and high-performance applications using Next.js, React, and Node.js. My experience with TypeScript ensures robust codebases and seamless integration across the stack.

In addition to web development, I bring extensive experience in native iOS development, working with technologies such as Swift and SwiftUI. This background enables me to architect cross-platform solutions seamlessly, providing a consistent user experience across both web and mobile platforms.

As a leader in the development space, I foster a collaborative environment, driving teams toward success through effective communication, mentorship, and adherence to agile methodologies like Scrum. My comprehensive skill set and experience allow me to deliver innovative solutions that exceed expectations, elevate the user experience, and achieve business objectives.
