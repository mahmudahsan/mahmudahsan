### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Over 8 years, I was an [Indie iOS developer](https://ithinkdiff.net/).<br />Since 2020, I am a Co-Founder and Senior Software Engineer of [Mefluence LLC](https://www.mefluence.com/).<br />It's an American company and I have been working remotely from Malaysia.

I love to share my knowledge through writing on **[thinkdiff.net](https://thinkdiff.net/)**<br />
I write about ***Swift, iOS, Flutter, Python, JavaScript, Firebase, etc.***
