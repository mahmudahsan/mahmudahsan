### Hi there 👋
I am a Bangladeshi computer programmer living in Malaysia. Currently, a lead software engineer working in [Mefluence](https://www.mefluence.com/) -- a U.S. based startup company. Before joining there, I was an [indie Mobile apps developer](https://ithinkdiff.net/) for over eight years. My indie apps downloaded over 15+ Million times from the Apple App Store and earned USD 500K+ revenue. 

I regularly write technical articles on ✍️ **[thinkdiff.net](https://thinkdiff.net/)
